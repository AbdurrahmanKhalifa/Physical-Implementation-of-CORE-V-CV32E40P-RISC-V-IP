Optimizing Exclusive Bound 'DEFAULT_VA' (2/2)
Warning: There is high fragmentation caused by many blockages or fixed cells.
	The median subrow width (space between blockages) is 42 sites
	and the median cell width is 12 sites. This makes it difficult for
	the legalizer to pack in the cells and can result in high
	displacements and long runtimes.
Please look for the GIF files that are written out at the end of
	legalization to see the impact of the fragmentation.
