NAME
       write_eco_design
              Writes  an  ECO  design that consumes less memory to perform ECO
              than the original design.

SYNTAX
       status write_eco_design
              [-type type_list]
              [-endpoints endpoint_list]
              [-force]
              [-merge_sessions session_list]
              [-verbose]
              [dir_name]

   Data Types
       type_list               list
       endpoint_list           list
       session_list            list
       dir_name                string

ARGUMENTS
       -type type_list
              Writes an ECO design  that  preserves  the  specified  violation
              types  compared to those in the original design. You can specify
              one or more of the following violation types:
              o setup - Preserves setup timing results.
              o hold - Preserves hold timing results.
              o max_transistion - Preserves max_transition results.
              o max_capacitance - Preserves max_capacitance results.
              o max_fanout - Preserves max_fanout results.
              o noise - Preserves noise results.
              o timing - Preserves setup and hold timing results.
              o drc  -  Preserves  max_transition,  max_capacitance,  and  max
                fanout results.

              If  you  specify  both  the  setup and hold violation types (the
              default behavior), the resulting ECO design will have setup  and
              hold  timing reports similar to those of the original design. If
              you specify only the hold violation type, the hold timing report
              will  be similar, but the setup timing report could be different
              because the ECO design does not contain  setup  timing  informa-
              tion.   If you specify more violation types, the ECO design size
              becomes larger. To minimize the ECO design  size,  specify  only
              necessary violation types.

       -endpoints endpoint_list
              Creates  an  ECO design with the specified timing endpoints. Use
              this option to customize your ECO design instead of creating  an
              ECO  design  with violation types. For example, if you have spe-
              cific timing endpoints for hold fixing but no interest in  other
              violating  endpoints,  using  this  option creates an ECO design
              that preserves hold timing to only these endpoints.

              This option provides great flexibility  to  customize  your  ECO
              design.  You can write your own scripts to collect specific end-
              points based on path groups, timing  margins,  and  slacks.  For
              more examples, see the EXAMPLES section.

       -merge_sessions session_list
              Creates  an  ECO  design  based on the endpoints merged from the
              specified PrimeTime saved sessions. Once the  option  is  speci-
              fied,  the  write_eco_design  command  merges endpoints from the
              specified directories and writes an  ECO  design  based  on  the
              merged  endpoints. Note that the eco_save_session_data_type must
              have been specified before saving the PrimeTime sessions to have
              violating endpoint data in the saved sessions.

              This  option  is  useful when an ECO design is generated without
              running DMSA, and works only in non-DMSA mode. See  the  details
              in the example section.

       -force This  options forces to write an ECO design even if ECO informa-
              tion is missing in the saved sessions.

       -verbose
              Shows additional information such as endpoint names and progress
              status.

       dir_name
              Specifies  a  directory  name in which an ECO design is created.
              The specified directory will contain multiple files  after  cre-
              ation. In Distributed Multi Scenario Analysis (DMSA), the speci-
              fied directory will have subdirectories in which  each  sechario
              creates its own ECO design.

              If  you  do  not  specify  a  directory  name,  the  default  is
              eco_design_directory.

DESCRIPTION
       This command reduces hardware requirements during timing closure ECO by
       creating an ECO design that requires less memory to perform ECO fixing.
       An ECO design is a small subset of the original  design  that  contains
       only  ECO-related  design  data. For example, it retains only cells and
       nets on critical paths and omits cells and nets on  noncritical  paths.
       Special  timing  and crosstalk models are created for disconnected nets
       and pins in the ECO design so that timing quality of results  (QoR)  in
       the  ECO design is very close to the timing QoR of the original design.
       Its goal is to have timing QoR close  enough  to  produce  similar  ECO
       change  lists for the place-and-route tool compared to the change lists
       generated from the original design.

       Note: it is not recommended to signoff with ECO designs.  Instead,  ECO
       designs  should  be  used only for ECO purposes, especially when you do
       not have enough hardware resources to perform timing closure ECO.

   Creating an ECO Design With Violation Types
       The write_eco_design command creates an ECO design that  preserves  the
       violation  type  you specify with the -type option. If the -type option
       is not specified, setup and hold will be used as a default. The follow-
       ing  command creates an ECO design that preserves setup and hold viola-
       tions under the default directory, eco_design_directory.

         write_eco_design

       The command creates a new directory, eco_design_directory,  which  con-
       tains  ECO  design  data.  If  a  directory  with the same name already
       exists, the command replaces the contents with new data. You  can  also
       specify  a  new  directory  name  if you do not want to use the default
       name. For example, this command creates an ECO  design  with  the  name
       my_eco_design.

         write_eco_design my_eco_design

       After  the command creates your new ECO design, use the read_eco_design
       command to load it and run ECO fixing.  Suppose  your  original  design
       consumes  100  gigabytes  (GB), but the ECO design consumes only 20 GB.
       Although you need machines bigger than 100  GB  to  run  static  timing
       analysis  (STA),  you can perform your ECO on smaller 32-GB machines as
       the ECO design consumes only 20 GB. For example,  after  the  preceding
       ECO  design is created in the my_eco_design directory, you can log into
       smaller machines with less memory, run the read_eco_design command, and
       perform timing fixing with the fix_eco_timing command:

         read_eco_design my_eco_design
         fix_eco_timing ...

       Use the -type option to specify the violation types that you are inter-
       estein to minimize your ECO design size. For example, this command pre-
       serves only hold violations:

         write_eco_design -type hold

       The resulting ECO design will preserve hold timing violations but might
       have different other timing violations such as  setup  and  max_transi-
       tion.  However,  hold  fixing results should be close to the results of
       the original design because the ECO design has the same  critical  hold
       paths preserved.

       Specifying  more violation types increases the size of an ECO design as
       it includes more paths. In the following  example,  the  first  command
       creates a bigger ECO design than the second command because it has more
       violation types.

         write_eco_design -type {setup hold max_transition max_capacitance}
         write_eco_design -type hold

   Creating an ECO Design in Distributed Multi-Scenario Analysis (DMSA)
       In a DMSA flow, run the write_eco_design command in the master to  cre-
       ate  an ECO design that includes all current scenarios. Suppose you are
       running DMSA with two scenarios, scen_1 and scen_2.  In  the  following
       example,   a   DMSA   master   creates   an   ECO   design   under  the
       my_dmsa_eco_design directory.

         write_eco_design my_dmsa_eco_design

       Under the my_dmsa_eco_design directory, the command creates the  scen_1
       and  scen_2 subdirectories, which contain ECO design data for each sce-
       nario. Next, load the ECO design by running the read_eco_design command
       in the master. The following example launches two slave hosts automati-
       cally and loads an ECO design under the my_dmsa_eco_design directory in
       each  scenario.  For  more  DMSA  examples,  see  the  man  page of the
       read_eco_design command.

         read_eco_design my_dmsa_eco_design

   Creating an ECO Design With Saved Sessions
       If you perform ECO from PrimeTime sessions that were saved  from  indi-
       vidual  PrimeTime  STA runs, follow the steps described in this section
       to run the write_eco_design command efficiently.

       First, set the eco_save_session_data_type variable to your desired vio-
       lation  types  before  saving sessions with the save_session command in
       individual PrimeTime STA runs. Setting this variable saves ECO informa-
       tion  in addition to timing data while PrimeTime saves its session. The
       saved ECO information will be used by the write_eco_design  command  to
       analyze  ECO  data  from  different scenarios efficiently. This example
       script saves setup and hold timing ECO information.

         set eco_save_session_data_type {setup hold}
         save_session scen_1_session

       Second, start DMSA as you normally do with your DMSA ECO. Since you are
       running  DMSA  from  individually saved sessions, the following typical
       DMSA script example restores saved sessions with the -image  option  of
       the  create_scenario  command.  Suppose  there  are two saved sessions,
       scen_1_session and scen_2_session:

         create_scenario -name scen_1 -image scen_1_session
         create_scenario -name scen_2 -image scen_2_session
         set_host_options -num_processes 2
         start_host
         current_session -all
         report_global_timing

       Third, run the write_eco_design command in the DMSA master to create an
       ECO  design that includes both scen_1 and scen_2 scenarios. In the fol-
       lowing example, PrimeTime writes an ECO design under the default direc-
       tory, eco_design_directory:

         write_eco_design

   Creating an ECO Design With Fewer Hosts Than Scenarios
       You can use fewer hosts than scenarios to create an ECO design. This is
       especially useful when your machine resource is limited.  For  example,
       suppose  there  are four scenarios that consume 100 GB to run PrimeTime
       STA for each scenario. However, at the time of ECO,  suppose  you  have
       only two 100-GB machines available. The following example uses only two
       machines to create an ECO design from four scenarios:

         #
         # Define four scenarios and their session locations
         #
         create_scenario -name scen_1 -image scen_1_session
         create_scenario -name scen_2 -image scen_2_session
         create_scenario -name scen_3 -image scen_3_session
         create_scenario -name scen_4 -image scen_4_session

         #
         # Configure hosts with two machines
         #
         set_host_options -num_processes 2
         start_host

         #
         # Create an ECO design from four scenarios
         #
         current_session -all
         current_scenario -all
         write_eco_design

         #
         # Exit or additional reporting
         # Note that reporting incurs session swapping that may cause runtime penalty.
         #
         # report...
         exit

       It is recommended to have the write_eco_design  command  as  the  first
       command  right  after the current_session and current_scenario commands
       before any reporting commands. This avoids scenario  swapping  that  is
       caused by merging reports from all scenarios.

   Creating an ECO Design With Timing Endpoints
       Specifying  specific  endpoint  list  for the -endpoints option enables
       PrimeTime to create an ECO design that preserves timing to  those  end-
       points. The following example creates an ECO design that preserves tim-
       ing to FF100/D and FF101/D pins.

         write_eco_design -endpoints { FF100/D FF101/D }

       The -endpoints option is a powerful tool to customize your ECO  design.
       You  can  write a TCL script that collects endpoints you are interested
       in and specify the endpoints for the option. For example, suppose  your
       design  has  100 hold violations, but you are interested in fixing only
       the 10 worst hold violations. The following example shows how  to  col-
       lect 10 worst hold violations and create an ECO design for them.

         set paths [get_timing_paths -nw 1 -max 10 -delay min]
         set hold_10_endpoints [get_attr $paths endpoint]
         write_eco_design -endpoints $hold_10_endpoints

       The following example creates an ECO design to perform hold fixing only
       for the CLOCK_GROUP_A clock group.

         set paths [get_timing_paths -group CLOCK_GROUP_A -delay min]
         set clk_group_a [get_attr $paths endpoint]
         write_eco_design -endpoints $clk_group_a

   Memory Reduction
       After an ECO design is written, memory reduction  may  not  be  propor-
       tional  to  the number of reduced cells because PrimeTime's memory con-
       sumption also includes fixed memory overhead like loading library.  For
       example,  a design loaded with a large number of larger libraries shows
       lower memory reduction than a design loaded with one small library.

       PrimeTime  shows  an  estimated  design  reduction  summary  after  the
       write_eco_design  command finishes. Note that the numbers are not exact
       but estimated values. The purpose of the estimate is to  provide  rough
       numbers  for  design reduction. Exact cell, net, and pin counts as well
       as peak memory will be available when the read_eco_design command  fin-
       ishes.

   Optimizing disk usage
       If  saved  sessions  are kept only for ECO purpose, you can reduce disk
       usage by removing the saved sessions after creating an ECO design. This
       is especially useful when there are many scenarios that take large disk
       space.

   Creating an ECO design in non-DMSA mode
       Specifying saved session directories for the -merge_sessions option  in
       non-DMSA  mode  enables PrimeTime to merge the violating endpoints from
       the saved sessions and create an ECO design based on  the  merged  end-
       points.  This  option  is designed to support to generate an ECO design
       without running DMSA.

       Suppose there are two STA scripts as shown below.

         # Script STA for FF running in Host1
         read_verilog...
         update_timing...
         set eco_save_sessions_data_type timing
         save_session $my_sessions/STA_SESSION_FF

         # Script STA for SS running in Host2
         read_verilog...
         update_timing...
         set eco_save_sessions_data_type timing
         save_session $my_sessions/STA_SESSION_SS

       Note that the  eco_save_sessions_data_type  variable  is  specified  to
       store  violating  endpoint  data in the saved sessions. After the saved
       sessions are created and available, the following scripts can  be  used
       to generate an ECO design under $rreco_db directory.

         # Script to write ECO design for FF running in Host1
         restore_session $my_sessions/STA_SESSIONS_FF
         set sess_list "$my_sessions/STA_SESSION_FF $my_sessions/STA_SESSION_SS"
         write_eco_design $rreco_db/FF -merge_sessions $sess_list

         # Script to write ECO design for SS running in Host2
         restore_session $my_sessions/STA_SESSIONS_SS
         set sess_list "$my_sessions/STA_SESSION_FF $my_sessions/STA_SESSION_SS"
         write_eco_design $rreco_db/SS -merge_sessions $sess_list

       Note  that  the write_eco_design command specifies a subdirectory under
       $rreco_db so that each subdirectory is assigned to  each  scenario.  In
       this  directory  structure,  the  following read_eco_design command can
       read in the ECO design in DMSA mode.

         # Script to read RRECO design in DMSA mode
         read_eco_design $rreco_db

EXAMPLES
       This section describes a few examples to convert existing  ECO  scripts
       to  new scripts utilizing the write_eco_design and read_eco_design com-
       mands.

   Single-Scenario Example Scripts
       The following example is a typical script  for  STA  and  ECO  combined
       together.

       The  preceding  script is separated into the two following scripts. The
       first script creates an ECO design after STA,  and  the  second  script
       loads  the  ECO  design  and  performs  ECO.  The second script runs on
       smaller machines assuming peak memory is reduced from 100 GB to 20  GB.

   Muti-Scenario Example Scripts
       The  following  example  is a typical script for DMSA ECO that restores
       saved sessions and performs ECO.

         #
         fix_eco_timing...
         remote_exec { write_changes... }
         exit

       The preceding script is separated into the two following  scripts.  The
       first  script  creates  an ECO design with only one 100-GB machine, and
       the second script loads the ECO design and performs ECO. Assuming  each
       scenario is reduced from 100 GB to 20 GB, all four scenarios can run in
       a single 100-GB machine.

       The first script to create an ECO design in one host is shown below.
