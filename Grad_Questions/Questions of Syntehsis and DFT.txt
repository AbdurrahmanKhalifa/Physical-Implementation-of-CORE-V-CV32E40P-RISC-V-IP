Some Questions
===============

1- Typical typical library is the only libraries that meets setup, what should we do and how come when using FF library for setup I get very bad slack instead of having one that is better than TT? (SOLVED)

Answer:

In FF libs we can have setup violation normally since some paths can be faster than the other in other words launching path can become faster than capture so that can happen normally 

the following libraries are the ones that are working

set SSLIB "saed14hvt_ss0p6v125c.db" 
set TTLIB "saed14hvt_tt0p6v25c.db"
set FFLIB "saed14hvt_ff0p88v125c.db"




2- Do I have to use output load of defined std_cell input cap? (SOLVED)

#set_load 0.3956 [all_outputs] input cap of buf_1
#set_load 1.59 [all_outputs]   input cap of buf_16
set_load 10 [all_outputs]


Answer:

We don't have to use the input capacitance on a std_cell instead we look for the maximum capacitance that the std_cell that will be connected to the output can handle and based on whether we work on an IP that will be connected to another module or we work on chip level and model the output load capacitance of another module or the external world  



3- During DFT formal verification, we encountered a mismatch on a net related to scan_cg_en_i and test_mode. The implementation had test_mode set to '0' (functional mode), while in the RTL, scan_cg_en_i was set to '1', leading to a comparison failure. However, since this signal was inserted in the original RTL solely for DFT purposes, can it be safely ignored in the equivalence check?
